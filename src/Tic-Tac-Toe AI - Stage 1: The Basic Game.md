# Tic-Tac-Toe AI - Stage 1: The Basic Game

## Description
This is the foundational stage of the Tic-Tac-Toe project. It sets up the standard 3x3 grid, handles basic user input for coordinates, and establishes the core game loop for two human players (Player vs Player).

## Key Features
* **Interactive Grid:** Displays the board and updates it after every turn.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures the user enters valid numbers (1-3) and checks that the chosen cell is not already occupied.
* **Win/Draw Detection:** Accurately calculates if X wins, O wins, or if the board is full resulting in a draw.
